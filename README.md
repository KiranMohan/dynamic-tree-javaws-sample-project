dynamic-tree-javaws-sample-project
==================================

Demo: Javaws as Web Application + Maven + JBoss EAP 6.3.0  

References:
* [webstart-maven-plugin](http://mojo.codehaus.org/webstart/webstart-maven-plugin/)
* [Oracle Java Web Start tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/webstart/). (Java code is taken from here)

The project has two maven modules
* dynamic-tree-javaws
* dynamic-tree-webapp

The module dynamic-tree-javaws contains the Java code plus a template.vm from which the JNLP file is generated by the [webstart-maven-plugin](http://mojo.codehaus.org/webstart/webstart-maven-plugin/). The webstart-maven-pluing signs the jar and package the jar + jnlp file into a zip file.

The zip file generated in webstart-maven-plugin is unzipped into dynamic-tree-webapp module using maven-dependency-plugin. The webapp module packages the project to a .war file that can be deployed to a JBoss EAP 6.3.0 Applications (this is the one I tested. Maybe it works on other Application Servers).
